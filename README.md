# project-dreamcar
A young man's four wheeled dream. For the past few months, the idea for this project was and is living in my head rent free and occupied vast majority of my 'thinking time'. I concluded that the only way to do something about it is to attempt to build it or get bored trying. My previous priject - building my first gokart from scratch without ever holding a welder in my hand and with no vehicle dynamics knowledge whatsoever was aiming for the moon, and I somewhat got there. During that project I realized that what I *really* dream of is to build my own actual racecar. Something I could race on the track, as well as cruise on the mountain roads.

This is by no mean my no. 1 priority in life, so I expect the progress to be slow and that's okay. I don't even have a place yet that I could build it in. I really enjoy, and frankly can't stop myself from, designing it one element at a time in my head and dreaming of building it. From now on, I'll attempt to compile those thoughts in CAD models and code. Let's see how it goes.
